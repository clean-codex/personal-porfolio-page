      <h3>MY JOURNEY</h3>
      I told you early that I'm going to tell you about my journey as a programmer and how I started.<br>Well, I never break my promise. In this section you'll see the way my coding journey has been<br>and how I started.
      <section class="journey">
        My coding journey is a one to remember.<br>All my life I have always been coding with a mobile device  e.g phone.<br>This has been like a very big set back for me because, for example, I can only make mobile responsive sites but can't make it responsive for laptop screens, and large screens<br>
        <hr />
        I first started learning to code late july of 2022.<br>
        I first started with c++ but I couldn't get anywhere coz it's a pretty complex language, so i quit it and moved to web development and i'm doing okay..ish <br>I first started with HTML and then moved to CSS and curently i'm still learning <abbr title="javascript">JS</abbr>.<br>
        Apart from web dev I've also learnt some other languages like python, django and also reactjs.<br>I am currently focusing on javascript and React js.
